# NetCICD #
## About ##
NetCICD is an Ansible based toolset to facilitate continuous (â€¦) in networking. In networking, Continuous Development (CI/CD) is not yet common practice. This is partly caused by lack of familiarity with the CD paradigm and lack of working tooling. NetCICD attempts to fill this void.

NetCICD takes an industrial automation approach to network development and deployment, with as ultimate goal to be able to do CI/CD/CD: 

- Continous Integration of new functionality, including automated testing
- Continuous Delivery of new functionality for deployment to production 
- Continuous Deployment: all new templates and workflows are automagically deployed to production
#### History ####
The first implementation was made in 2018 and was presented at [Cisco Live 2018 in Barcelona](https://www.ciscolive.com/c/dam/r/ciscolive/emea/docs/2019/pdf/BRKSDN-2158.pdf). 

It has shown to be pretty complex to create a tooling pipeline for Network based CICD. Navigating the tools space, configuring the tools properly and making a reliable pipeline out of it is more than can be expected of network engineers.

As a result, the [NetCICD Developer Toolbox](https://github.com/Devoteam/NetCICD-developer-toolbox) was created, which is being developed by DevOps Engineers within Devoteam. It contains all tools required (git, Jenkins, Nexus and Keycloak for SSO) to make the NetCICD environment run locally. In addition, tools to support service development and automation are included, like Jupyter Notebook and Node Red. We are working to include [Argos](https://www.argosnotary.com/) to include a continuous auditing mechanism so that it becomes possible to prove that the deployment (git commit) you are running operationally is actually the version tested and for which the test report can be found in you local Nexus repo.

Both NetCICD and the NetCICD Developer Toolbox are aimed towards local deployment, for example on your laptop or within the walled garden of your operations environment. For more information, please contact networkautomation at devoteam.nl.

## Installation ##
Installation should be done by installing the [NetCICD Developer Toolbox](https://github.com/Devoteam/NetCICD-developer-toolbox). This repo can be found in the Gitea environment under the organisation Devoteam. 
## Environment ##
NetCICD is developed on a Ubuntu 20.04 laptop with CML Personal edition version 2.1. (Work for migrating NetCICD from VIRL 1.5 to CML2.1 is currently being done). For more information see the wiki attached to this repo.
